<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Hidhayathulla, a Computer Science Engineering student at Sathyabama University, batch of 2024-2028. I was born and raised in Tenkasi, Tamil Nadu, India. I completed my 12th grade with <u>86 percent</u> and have a solid academic background. I bring a range of technical skills to the table, including proficiency in <u>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</u>. On the creative side, I specialize in photography, video editing, poster designing, basic design work, and screenwriting. I also have experience with photo retouching and color grading.</p>

    <p>Outside of academics and tech, I enjoy reading non-fiction and self-help books, listening to audio podcasts, and taking photos of birds. I believe in lifelong learning and constantly seek opportunities to expand my skills. If you'd like to connect to discuss technology, creativity, or career opportunities, I'm always interested in meeting new people who share similar interests.</p>
